## About

I'm happy to present the latest Arkanum release version `1.6.0`.

This release includes the following changes:

## Product Image Update

We updated the Arkanum images to be able to generate the favicons and PWA icons for the code-server image.

These are the curren image iterations:

## Starting a Matrix Space

We decided to use Matrix for building the Arkanum community.

Feel free to join the [public community space](https://matrix.to/#/#arkanum:matrix.org).

[![Chat on Matrix](https://matrix.to/img/matrix-badge.svg)](https://matrix.to/#/#arkanum:matrix.org)

We also think about hosting a _Discourse_ or _Apache Answer_ based forum whenever needed. This could help collecting
all useful community resources like discussions, FAQs, and guides without searching in a room history.

## Added Tools <Badge type="tip" text="v1.6.0++" />

- We added [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) in arkanum-cli.
- We also added the bash alias `summon` for _code-server_.

## Dependencies

- Updated Code-Server to `v4.91.0`
- Updated dependencies used in WoodpeckerCI workflows.

## Changelog
